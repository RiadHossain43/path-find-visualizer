# path_find_visualizer

Just clone this git repository and you will be able to
see the visual project.
Just open the inde.html file in any browser with a live server on to play with it.
If no live server is used the app may crash.

Notes:

1. algorithom2.js
2. disktra.js 
3. disktra2.js 

are not used for the live project. I have been using them for testing in the development only.
